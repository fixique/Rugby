# üì¶ How to install

### Introduction

The previous version has four ways to install:

1. **Package managers**:
    1. üå±¬†**Mint**. Allows selecting any git reference, cloning it, and building Rugby from\
    source code. There are two disadvantages. First of all, users should have the right Xcode\
    version and CLT. It‚Äôs not so convenient. Sometimes users have to use older Xcode versions.\
    And it also limits me from upgrading to the latest version and using the newest features\
    for development. The second problem is I‚Äôm not ready to publish the source code of the new version;
    2. üç∫ **Brew**. Allows downloading only the latest Rugby binary and only from the default branch.\
    It‚Äôs not suitable for the distribution of pre-release versions. And users can‚Äôt get the previous\
    version if the latest one is broken.
2. **W/o package managers**:
    1. üìë **Source**. Everybody can clone any git reference without package managers and build Rugby from\
    the source. There is only one problem ‚Äî I‚Äôm not ready to share the source code of the new version üòÖ;
    2. üì¶ **Binary**. Everybody can download a zip file, unarchive it and use the Rugby binary.\
    It‚Äôs pretty easy, but still, users have to call a bunch of commands, like adding Rugby location\
    to the `$PATH` environment variable.

I thought about all these options and decided that there should be a better way to install Rugby.\
And I found it. Maybe it‚Äôs not ideal, but it‚Äôs good enough.

It‚Äôs all about downloading binary. The first-time users should install it manually, and after that,\
they can use the new command `rugby update` for Rugby self-updating. It‚Äôs similar to the package manager,\
but it's right inside Rugby.

## First Install (zsh)

Select your architecture: `arm64` or `x86_64`. Run the five commands below. I described them in points 1-5:

1. Create and change the current directory to `~/.rugby/clt/downloads` (recommended);
2. Download the specific version of Rugby. E.g. `2.0.0b9`;
3. Unzip archive;
4. Copy binary from `~/.rugby/clt/downloads/rugby` to `~/.rugby/clt`;
5. Add Rugby path to your `$PATH` environment variable. After this call you can use `rugby` in your\
terminal without passing the whole path `~/.rugby/clt`. You need to open a new window or tab in terminal.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.rugby/clt/downloads && cd ~/.rugby/clt/downloads
```

<details><summary><code>x86_64 (Intel)</code></summary>
<p>

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/swiftyfinch/Rugby/releases/download/2.0.0b9/x86_64.zip
```
```bash
unzip x86_64.zip
```

<hr>
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><code>arm64 (M1+)</code></summary>
<p>

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/swiftyfinch/Rugby/releases/download/2.0.0b9/arm64.zip
```
```bash
unzip arm64.zip
```

<hr>
</p>
</details>

```bash
cp rugby ~/.rugby/clt
```
```bash
echo '\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.rugby/clt' >> ~/.zshrc
```
Open a new window or tab in terminal.

<details><summary>How to keep the first Rugby version (e.g. during beta)</summary>
<p>

Instead of adding the path to your `$PATH` environment variable in the 5th point, use an alias like `rugby2`.

```bash
echo '\nalias rugby2="~/.rugby/clt/rugby"' >> ~/.zshenv
```
Open a new window or tab in terminal.

</p>
</details>

## Self-Update

If you already have Rugby, which version is at least `2.0.0b2`, you can use such a command.\
But it will work only if you install rugby to `~/.rugby/clt/rugby` path as I recommended above.

Getting the latest version including pre-release ones:

```bash
rugby update --beta
```

If you want to install a specific version:

```bash
rugby update --version 2.0.0b9
```

If you want to find out which versions are available:

```bash
rugby update list
```
